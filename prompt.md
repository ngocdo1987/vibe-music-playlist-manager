Typography: Avoid generic fonts (Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato), suggest alternatives like JetBrains Mono, Playfair Display, IBM Plex family 
Color & Theme: Commit to cohesive aesthetic, use CSS variables for consistency, dominant colors with sharp accents
Motion: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions, prioritize CSS-only solutions, focus on high-impact moments
Backgrounds: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors

Let's random another HTML design.
